# Using MQTT With the JackBord from Github Codespaces 

11 March 2025 

# 1.0 General

In this exercise we will use the [https://github.com/penpcol/JackBord\_Python\_MQTT](https://github.com/penpcol/JackBord_Python_MQTT) Github repository to use MQTT to interact with the JackBord.

# 2.0 Create the New Repository

![Jack](image1)

# 3.0 Add a Codespace

Now we need to create a codespace to use in the repository.  
From the repositories main page click the **Code** button.

Next we need to create a codespace for the repository so we can use it.   
To do this click on the green **Code** button, on the right of the page, and choose the Codespaces tab. 

Then click the â€¦ dots menu, shown in the red box. You will see this:

Now select  \+ New with options.

![][image2]

Set the following values:

Branch						Main  
Region						Leave at default value  
Machine type  					4-core

**Note:**  You need the 4-core version to run Ollama properly as it has 16G of RAM.

Click **Create** codespace.

It may take some time to get setup but when its done it should look something like this:

![][image3]

By default it shows you the repository Readme file.

## 3.2 Add a New Python Program File

Now we need to add a new Python file to hold our code.   
When you run your mouse over the explorer on the left you should see these icons at the top appear.

![][image4]

Click on the New File icon shown below:  
![][image5]  
Give it a name and press Enter:

![][image6]

On the right you should see a new tab with the filename you provided as its name. This is where we will edit the code.

![][image7]

Paste the code below into the new editor window:

```python  
"""
    DeepSeek_Version1.py

    This version uses DeepSeek AI Model.

    11 March 2025 > This is for use with the JackBord BASIC, PRO or Virtual.

        It connects to the JackBord MQTT Server using your JackBords profile credentials
        and listens to the PID/# mqtt topic for data from your JackBord.

        Where PID is the JackBords dashboard profile ID.
        Mqtt messages sent to and from the JackBord are visable in the terminal.

    NOTE: You need to get the unique credentials for your JackBord as stated 
            in the repository readme.

### 3.21 Install the Recommended Python

When you paste the code into the window you may see a popup like the one below. If you do click **Install**, this installs the required Python extension for Visual Code.

![][image8]  
When done it should look like this:  
![][image9]

You can close this window.

## 3.3 Getting Your MQTT Credentials from the Dashboard

Before the program will work you need to get the credentials from the dashboard you are using with your Virtual JackBord.

On the dashboard of your running Virtual JB click the JackBord BASIC icon on the top right.

Once the new browser tab is open look at the URL in the address bar. In our case it was like this:

![][image10]

The information you need for the program is as follows:

jb\_pid \= "your pid"  
jb\_username \= "your id"  
jb\_password \= "your pw"

If we fill in the variables based on the URL we got they will look like this (yours will be different):

\# My Virtual JackBord  
jb\_pid \= "10GT"  
jb\_username \= "113568327219567611054"  
jb\_password \= "176642e451"

Note where each of the values resides in the URL.

## 3.4 Installing paho

Next we need to install the paho mqtt library using pip. At the terminal type:

	**pip install paho-mqtt**

Paho will be installed and once done you should see this:

![][image11]

## 3.5 Run the Program

Make sure you have saved the code and then run it by clicking on the **Run ![][image12]** button at the top right of the editor window.

You should see something like this in the terminal:

![][image13]

The program starts by sending hi to the JackBord and it responds with:

Hello from 10GT
